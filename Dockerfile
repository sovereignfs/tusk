# This app as one image (contracts/app-manifest.md §4): a process that is not root, configured by its environment alone, listening on
# the port its manifest names, that applies its own migrations when it starts.
#
# The manifest (sovereign.manifest.json) is the one place the port is written, and the image's label is made from it, so build with the
# arguments @sovereignfs/manifest prints from it:
#
#   eval "docker build $(pnpm exec sovereign-manifest docker-args) -t tusk ."
#
# The base is Debian ("glibc"), not Alpine: libSQL's native client, which the `file:` form of the database loads, has no build for musl
# (DESIGN.md §22.1). The sqld and PostgreSQL forms would run on either, but one image has to run all three.

 * Brings the server up, or stops it. The standalone server would otherwise stay up and answer, and an instance would find the mistake from a
 * person using it:
 *
 * 1. The settings are checked, and a wrong one stops the server, naming it.
 * 2. The database is provisioned, opened and migrated (DESIGN.md §22.1), and the server does not start if it cannot. It waits for one that is
 *    still starting, up to TUSK_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS, since in a compose file the app and its database come up together.
 *
 * 3. The background jobs start, unless `TUSK_WORKER=off` (src/jobs), and stop when the process is told to (SIGTERM, which Docker sends).

/**
 * How people sign in (DESIGN.md §6), checked once at start-up with the other settings (`src/config/index.ts`), which is why this reads through
 * a function it is given and not the environment. A wrong setting is a problem that stops the server, and no message carries a value.
 *
 *   TUSK_AUTH_LOCAL                 1 or true: email and password. Off means off: `/sign-in`, `/sign-up` and `/api/auth` answer 404.
 *   TUSK_AUTH_SECRET[_FILE]         32 characters or more, to sign sessions and tokens. Required with local sign-in.
 *   TUSK_AUTH_SIGNUP                `closed` (the default with local sign-in): the first account is made and then sign-up is refused, by the
 *                                    server. `open`: anyone who can reach the page. A self-hoster who forgets is not an open registration.
 *                                    With a core as the only way in the default is `open`: the core decides who may sign in.
 *   TUSK_AUTH_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH   the shortest password, 10 by default.
 *   TUSK_URL                        the address people use; required with either way (links, cookies, passkeys and the redirect are made from it).
 *   TUSK_CORE_URL, TUSK_CORE_CLIENT_ID, TUSK_CORE_CLIENT_SECRET[_FILE]
 *                                   Sovereign sign-in, through a core (DESIGN.md §6): all three or none. Either way, or both, can be on.
 *
 * With none of the ways on there is no sign-in at all, and the other settings here are not read.

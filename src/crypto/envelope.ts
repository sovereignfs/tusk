/**
 * Envelope encryption of a credential (DESIGN.md §9.2, §21.2): **AES-256-GCM with a random data key for each credential, and the data key wrapped under the
 * instance key.** A value is sealed to the row and purpose it belongs to: **both are in the authenticated data of both layers**, and the wrapping's also names the key,
 * so a sealed value moved to another row or used for another purpose does not open, and neither does one whose wrapping was re-labelled with another key.
 * Rotation moves only the wrapping (`rewrap`), so the payload, and the key that made it, are never seen together by anything but `open`.
 *
 * The form is `t1.<key fingerprint>.<wrapped data key>.<payload>`, each part base64url. Nothing here logs, and **an error says what kind of failure it was and
 * never a value**: not the secret, not the key, not the binding.

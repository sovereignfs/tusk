/**
 * The Content-Security-Policy every page is sent with, and the headers that go with it (DESIGN.md §23, task 1.7).
 *
 * Task text and names come from people, and with keys in the page (DESIGN.md §9) a page must stay safe even if a way to put markup in them were
 * found: nothing may run that the server did not mark, and nothing third-party may load.
 *
 *  - **Scripts** run only with this request's nonce, or when a script that has it loads them (`'strict-dynamic'`): the bundles Next adds, and the
 *    theme script in the layout. No inline handler, no `javascript:` address, no `eval` (but in development, where React wants it). Nothing
 *    broader is allowed for WebAssembly: the cryptography is Web Crypto and JavaScript.
 *  - **Style *elements*** carry the nonce too. **Style *attributes* are allowed**: React's `style` props and the design system's overlays position
 *    things with them, and an attribute can change how something looks but cannot run anything.
 *  - **Everything else comes from this origin**: images (and `data:` and `blob:`), fonts (the design system's own, served from here), `connect-src`
 *    (sync, the one API a browser calls), the service worker (`worker-src`) and the manifest. No frames, no plugins, nobody may frame a page
 *    (`frame-ancestors`), forms go only here, `<base>` cannot be changed.
 *  - **`upgrade-insecure-requests`** only where the app is served over https: on `http://localhost` it would send the page's own requests to a port
 *    that does not speak https.
 *
 * The nonce is new for every request and unguessable; a page that uses it cannot be prerendered, which is why every page is rendered per request.
